# Farm Game
**Objective**

The objective of this exercise is to create a PHP application that performs the following game.

A web page must be produced as the interface to play the game. Styling is not expected nor necessary.

The application must run through a browser

**The game**

We have a farm with:

- 1 farmer: needs to be fed at least once every 15 turns. 
- 2 cows: each cow needs to be fed at least once every 10 turns
- 4 bunnies: each bunny needs to be fed at least once every 8 turns

If any of the animals or the farmer are not fed on time, they die. If the farmer die, all animals die and game is over.

If farmer, 1 cow and 1 bunny are still alive after 50 turns, you win. 

**How to play**

- There’s a button to start a new game
- There’s a button to randomly feed an animal/farmer. Every click on this button is a turn. 50 is maximun number of turns

**What we are expecting**
- Create a new branch for you to use and push your code.
- Add all commits when possible for us to see your work process
- We want to see your PHP skills. 
- Please, add some unit test for us where appropriate.

Good luck and thanks for your time and interest :+1:
